MCMD
=================================
Monkey See Monkey Do is a gnome extension to set the display brightness
based on ambient light detected by the camera sensor.

Status & Dependencies
===============================================
Currently MCMD requires python-dbus, gst-python and gi.repository to work. Also, current DE support is limited to gnome. A full fledged gnome-shell extension is set to be released soon.
I plan to support other DEs at a later date.

Installation
===============================================
Currently the project works as a standalone python application. No installation is required

git clone git@github.com:ambasta/mcmd.git
python mcmd &
